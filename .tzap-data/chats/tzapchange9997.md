I see. The reason your original logging configuration didn't work was because you imported the `logs.logger` module in `context/app.py`. 

The issue here is that the `logs.logger` module creates the logger object and sets up the handlers, so it is executed as soon as you import it into the `context/app.py` module. 

However, since the Flask application is not yet created at the time the `logs.logger` module is imported in `context/app.py`, there is no effect to the Flask's logging configuration when the logger is initially set up.

To fix your approach, you could have the `logs.logger` module return the `logger` object instead of adding the handlers to it. Then, in `context/app.py`, you would add the handlers to the logger object after Flask's app object is created.

Another approach would be to configure your logger as early as possible in the application's startup code.
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='votebuddy.log', level=logging.DEBUG)

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # the rest of your application setup code
    
    return app
```
This configuration will log all severity messages from `DEBUG` and up to the `votebuddy.log` file you've specified here. The `basicConfig` method should be called as early as possible in the code startup of your application to ensure that all logging events, including those emitted by other libraries or modules, go to this destination.

Ok, I added the logging code directly to context.app.py rather than setting it up in it's own file and that seemed to work. Could you explain what was wrong with my setup in the other file?

@role:assistant
Given that the `print` statement is working inside the `interaction()` view function, we can conclude that logging is not properly configured in your Flask application.

Can you confirm that the Flask application that is being run is indeed the one with the logging configuration? If you have more than one Flask application or more than one logging configuration, this could cause issues.

Also, can you confirm that the `logs/votebuddy.log` file is being created when your Flask application starts up? If the file does not exist, the logs may be written to standard output instead.

Ok, I tried changing the logging level to Debug, but I am still getting nothing. The print statement did work

Shell output:
INFO  [werkzeug]  * Debugger PIN: 577-415-488
Inside interaction route

logging code:
    print("Inside interaction route")
        print("Processing Interaction form...")

It is strange that you are not seeing any logging output. Have you tried increasing the severity level of the messages that are logged to confirm that the logger is working properly?

For example, you could try changing the severity level of your logger to `logging.DEBUG` instead of `logging.INFO`. This should log all messages with severity level `DEBUG` and higher.

If you still don't see any log messages after changing the severity level, then my suggestion is to add debug prints before the logging statements. This can help isolate if the logging configuration is the issue.

For example, you could add `print()` statements before and after a logging statement to see if the logging statement itself is being executed but not producing any output. On some systems, the default Python logging configuration suppresses some severity levels of messages.

I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how logs work here. I tried adding it to the main.py which should be after the apps creation, but I am still getting none of my logging output.

You can configure the logger in `context/app.py`, as long as the `logger` object is available in the Flask application's context.

However, it is not recommended to use the `logger` object before the Flask application is created, as this can create circular import dependencies, which can be difficult to debug. In your case, you should make sure that all your import statements are below the creation of the Flask application, because `create_app()` contains the logger initialization. 

Here is an example:

```python
from flask import Flask
# import other required libraries
from context.database import db
import logging

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # import other Python files here 
    ...
    
    # create the logging object
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    
    # Create file handler
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler('votebuddy.log')
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    ...
    
    # Add the handlers to the logger
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)

    # initialize the database
    db.init_app(app)
    ...
    return app
```

This code initializes the logger object in `create_app()`, which is called only after all import statements.

So I can't set the logger for the entire app in the context/app.py file?

@role:assistant
I see. It appears that you are importing the `logger` object from `logs/logger.py` at the top of the file, but the logger's settings are not being applied.

To fix this, you should move the import of `logger` to after the call to `create_app()`. 

Here is an example of how your `interaction.py` file should look like:

```python
from flask import Blueprint, request, redirect, url_for
import csv
from flask import render_template
from forms.interaction_form import InteractionForm
from models.models import Recipient, Sender, Campaign, Interaction, InteractionStatus
from context.constants import INTERACTION_TYPES
from tools.utility import add_llm_response_to_conversation, initialize_conversation
from context.database import db

# Import the functions from the other files

import io

interaction_bp = Blueprint('interaction', __name__)

@interaction_bp.route('/interaction/<last_action>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def interaction(last_action):
    try:
        logger = current_app.logger

        print("Processing Interaction form...")

        # Create instance of InteractionForm class
        form = InteractionForm()

        # When the form is submitted
        if form.validate_on_submit():
            
            # The CSV file should have a header row and the following columns:
            # - Recipient Name: The name
            ...
```

This ensures that the logger has access to the context of the Flask application, including the logging configuration that is set up in `logs/logger.py`.

A simple example is on line 21 of routes/interaction.py

   print("Processing Interaction form...")

This logging statement does not show up in my file or in the shell.
---
@role:assistant
That's correct, the logging configuration should be handled in the logs/logger.py file. 

Can you show me an example of how you are using your `logger` object in another file?
---
@role:user
No, I do the set up in logs/logger.py
---
@role:assistant
Yes, there could be something wrong with your app configuration in app.py. Do you have any code in this file that is responsible for handling logging configuration?
---
@role:user
I am still not getting anything from the logger. I feel like I'm missing something in app.py maybe?
---
@role:assistant
Yes, the handler is set up correctly in logger.py.

It creates both a file handler and a console handler, and each handler has a formatter attached to it. The level of the console handler is set to `print`, meaning it will log any message with `print` severity or higher to the console. 

The level of the file handler is also set to `print`, meaning it will log any message with `print` severity or higher to the file designated in the handler settings.

Additionally, you include the `__name__` variable when creating the logger in logger.py. This ensures that the logger name matches the module it is being used in.
---
@role:user
Can you check logger.py and let me know if the handler is set up correctly?
---
@role:assistant
This may be due to the issue with the way you imported logger in other files. In logger.py, you are using `__name__` as the logger name, make sure to use the same name when importing logger into other Python files, as follows:

```python
# in other python file
from logs.logger import logger

print("log message")
```

Also, make sure that you have properly configured your logging handlers and formatters in logger.py.

@role:user
When I call print in any of my files from logger.py, no logging happens.
