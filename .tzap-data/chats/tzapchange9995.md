Hmm, that's strange. Let's try redirecting the output of `print` statements to a file in a different way. You can replace all your `print` statements with the following code snippet instead:

```
import sys

# Open a file for writing
stdout_fileno = sys.stdout.fileno()
with open('log.txt', 'wb') as log_file:
    # Replace stdout with the file we just opened
    sys.stdout = log_file
    # Run some code that prints to the console
    print('This is a test')
    # Reset stdout back to the original value
    sys.stdout = sys.stdout
```

This should redirect the output of `print` statements to a file named `log.txt`. 

Can you add this code to your `main.py` file and try running the app again? Let me know if it works.
---
@role:user
When I try that nothing is written to the log.txt file. It is created, but empty.
---
@role:assistant
Okay, in that case, let's try a different approach. Instead of using `logger`, let's use `print` statements to debug your code. 

You can add `print` statements in the code, where you want to check the value of a variable or to log an error message. This will print the output to the console when you run the Flask app. You can also use the `print` function to output to a file instead. You can add this code to the top of your `interaction.py` file:

```
import sys
sys.stdout = open('log.txt', 'w')
```

This will redirect all printed output to a file named `log.txt`. You can then use a text editor to view the contents of the file.

Finally, make sure that the Flask app is running in debug mode by setting `debug=True` when running the app:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Let me know if this helps in debugging your code.

I tried that and it had no effect. I also tried in the logger file creating a new logger each time it's called. It also appears to have no effect. Again, none of the logger or logging messages are showing up in the file log or in the shell log.

new logger.py:
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
import sys


def get_logger():
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        handlers=[
            RotatingFileHandler(
                'logs/app.log',
                maxBytes=1024 * 1024 * 5, # 5 MB
                backupCount=5
            ),
            logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
        ]
    )

    return logging.getLogger(__name__)

usage in interaction.py
from flask import Blueprint, request, redirect, url_for, current_app
import csv
# import Flask and other libraries
from flask import render_template
from forms.interaction_form import InteractionForm
from models.models import Recipient, Sender, Campaign, Interaction, InteractionStatus

interaction_bp = Blueprint('interaction', __name__)
logger = get_logger()

@interaction_bp.route('/interaction/<last_action>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def interaction(last_action):
    try:
        print("Inside interaction route")
        logging.info("Inside interaction route with logging.info")
        print("Inside interaction route with print")
        print("This should be an error message")
        print("This should be a debug message") 
        print("This should be an info message")
        print("Processing Interaction form...")
        print("Test debug message")
---
@role:assistant
Okay, let's try something else. We can try to log the messages to a separate file and see if that works. You can do this by creating a new `FileHandler` object and adding it to the logger.

```
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
import sys

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

file_handler = RotatingFileHandler('logs/app.log', maxBytes=1024*1024*5, backupCount=5)
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```

This will log the messages to a file named `app.log` in the `logs` directory. It will keep up to 5 old log files, with a maximum size of 5MB each. Please ensure that you create a 'logs' folder before running the app.

You can add this code to any location in your code where the logger is instantiated. 

Can you try this and let me know if it helps?
---
@role:user
I have added logger.setLevel in interaction.py. I got no change in the output
---
@role:assistant
It's weird that the logger isn't logging anything. I see that you are calling print and print multiple times. Maybe the logger level is not set correctly. You can try setting the logger level to logging.DEBUG and see if that fixes the issue. You can add the line below after instantiating the logger object.

```
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Let me know if that works.

@role:assistant
It looks like the `interaction.py` module is not importing the logger correctly. Since you are using the same logger name in multiple modules, it's best to define it in one place and then import it in the other modules.

To fix the issue in `interaction.py`, you can remove the following line:

```
from logs.logger import logger
```

and replace it with the following:

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

This will create a logger instance with the same name as the current module and use the configuration set in `logger.py`. You should do the same for any other modules that use `logger`.

I've updated my logger.py to set the logger config. I can tell it's at least partically working because the new "app.log" file was created. As you can see, I am still printing the route registration, but I am not printing in the interaction.py. I am still importing it correctly and have several test messages as we discussed earlier

@role:assistant
It looks like the logger messages are being written to the log file as expected, but they are not showing up in the console output. This is because the console logger has a default log level of "warning", meaning it will only display messages with a severity level of "warning" or higher. The messages you added are all at the "info" or "debug" level, which are lower than "warning". 

To change the log level for the console logger, you can modify the logger configuration to increase the minimum severity level. For example, you can update the `logger_config` dictionary to include the following:

```
logger_config = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'formatters': {
        'default': {
            'format': '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
        }
    },
    'handlers': {
        'file': {
            'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
            'level': 'INFO',
            'formatter': 'default',
            'filename': 'logs/app.log',
            'maxBytes': 1024 * 1024 * 5, # 5 MB
            'backupCount': 5
        },
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'level': 'DEBUG', # Change this to INFO or DEBUG
            'formatter': 'default',
            'stream': 'ext://sys.stdout'
        }
    },

---
@role:assistant
I see, it sounds like the logger configuration is set up correctly but the `interaction` function is not producing any log messages.

To investigate this more, you can add some `logger` calls within the `interaction` function and see if they are written to the log file. For example, you can modify the `try` block of the `interaction` function to include the following:

```
try:
    print("Inside interaction route")
    print("This should be an error message")
    print("This should be a debug message") 
    print("This should be an info message")
    print("Processing Interaction form...")
    print("Test debug message")
```

Once you've added these messages, restart the server and then submit the form to trigger this function. After doing so, verify that the messages you added are written to the log file. 

If they are, you can continue adding additional `logger` calls throughout the rest of the function to isolate where the problem might be. If they are not, let me know and we can continue troubleshooting.
---
@role:user
The file does exist. Only the logs from the blueprint are showing up. Each of those times was me restarting the server. And I would have expected to see the logs from the Interaction route there as well.

Here are the last few lines of the votebuddy.logs file:
2023-06-20 14:39:27,889 - logs.logger - INFO - Registering routes
2023-06-20 14:48:21,752 - logs.logger - INFO - Registering routes

2023-06-20 14:48:40,014 - logs.logger - INFO - Registering routes
---
@role:assistant
Great! Then it looks like you're doing everything correctly, including importing the `logger` object into each function where you use it.

Next, let's move on to checking the third suggestion and make sure that your logging messages are being written to a log file.

In your `logger.py` file, you've added a `WatchedFileHandler` called `file_handler` which should log all of your messages to the `votebuddy.log` file. Can you confirm that this file exists in the `logs` directory of your project?

Additionally, can you verify that logging messages are being written to this file? To do this, you can open the file using a text editor and check whether there are any messages written there. Or you can add a message to one of your `logger` calls (e.g. `print('This is a test message!')`) and check if the message is written to the file when the program runs.
---
@role:user
If I understand what you're saying correctly, yes that is how I am using it. The interaction file I just shared is representative of all the routes.
---
@role:assistant
I see that you have imported the `logger` object from the `logger.py` module and are using it to log messages within the `interaction` function.

You've also added `print`, `print`, and `print` messages which will help you to keep track of what's happening in your program.

To use the `logger` object in other functions within the `interaction.py` file, you'll need to import it at the top of each function. 

For example, if you have a function called `my_function` in the `interaction.py` file, you could add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```
from logs.logger import logger 
```

And then, within the function, you could log messages using:

```
print("Debug message")
print("Info message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
print("Error message")
logger.critical("Critical message")
```

Can you confirm that you are using the `logger` object in this way in any other functions in `interaction.py` and in other routes files?
---
@role:user
This is the beginning of the interaction.py file:

from flask import Blueprint, request, redirect, url_for, current_app

        print("This should be an error message")
        print("This should be a debug message")

        print("Processing Interaction form...")
        print("Test debug message")
---
@role:assistant
Great, the `logger` level is set to `DEBUG` in the `logger.py` file.

Let's move on to the second suggestion and check whether you're using the same `logger` object in the `routes`.
In the `routes/interaction.py` file, can you confirm that you have the following line at the top of the file, just above the imports?

   ```
   from logs.logger import logger
   ```

This should import the `logger` object from the `logger.py` module and make it available to use in the `routes/interaction.py`.

Then, within the `handle_interaction` function, you should use `logger` instead of `print` to log messages. The code should look something like this:

   ```
   print("Debug message")
   print("Info message")
   logger.warning("Warning message")
   print("Error message")
   logger.critical("Critical message")
   ```

Can you confirm whether you have these lines in the `routes/interaction.py` file, and that you are not using `print` statements to log messages?
---
@role:user
This is my logger.py file:

import logging
from logging.handlers import WatchedFileHandler

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Create logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create file handler
file_handler = WatchedFileHandler('logs/votebuddy.log')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create formatter
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Add formatter to handlers
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
---
@role:assistant
Sure thing. Let's start with the first suggestion and check the `logging` level.

In the `logger.py` file, you can set the level to `DEBUG` by adding the following line:

   ```
   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```
   
This will set the logger level to `DEBUG` and allow you to log `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages.

Can you confirm that this line is in your `logger.py` file?
---
@role:user
I think my code has each of those elements. Can you check the appropriate files and confirm.
---
@role:assistant
It seems like the logger is not writing to the log handler that you defined in `logger.py`. There could be a few reasons for this:

1. Make sure the logging level is set to at least the level you're trying to log. By default, the lowest level of logging enabled is `WARNING`. You can set the level of the logger by adding this line in the `logger.py` file:

   ```
   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

   This will set the logger level to `DEBUG` and allow you to log `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages.
   
2. Ensure that the `logger` object in the `routes` file is the same as the `logger` object that you created in `logger.py`. Import the `logger` object from the `logger` module. In `routes/interaction.py`, add the following line:

   ```
   from logs.logger import logger
   ```
   
   Then, use this `logger` object to write the logs. If you're not using the same `logger` object, the logs will not be written to the log file.

3. Check the configuration of the logger. It's possible that the logger is not properly configured to write to the log file. In the `logger.py` module, you can add a `StreamHandler` object to write the log messages to the console. If the `StreamHandler` object is working, it will write the log messages to the console. You can do this by adding this line:

   ```
   stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
   logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
   ```
   
   After you add these lines, you should see the log messages in the console. If the log messages are not appearing in the console, then there could be an issue with the way the logger is configured.

It looks like the `print` statement is working fine but the `print` statement isn't being executed. I would first recommend checking the import statements at the top of the file to make sure that the `logger` object being used in that file is the same one being used in the main Flask application.

If the import statements are correct and everything seems to be in order, then I would suggest adding in a `print` statement right before the `print` statement to see if the log message is being skipped due to the log level. 

```
print("This should appear in the logs")
print("Processing Interaction form...")
```
This way, you can check if the log message is being skipped because the log level is set to a higher value than `info`. If the debug message appears in the log, you can adjust the level of the `logger` object to `debug` to see if the `print` statement appears in the log.

So I am printing a simple, statement with the only difference being that I note one is done by the print statement.

It's good to see that the `print` statement in `routes/blueprint.py` is being printed, which confirms that the logger is properly set up and being used by the Flask application.

However, seeing that the `print` statement in `routes/interaction.py` is not being printed is still unexpected. It looks like there may be something specific to that route that is preventing the logger from being used.

Could you try calling the logger one more time, but with a simpler message, like so? 

```
print("Processing Interaction form...")
print("Processing Interaction form...")
```

This way, you can see if it's an issue with the logger not working correctly in that route, or if it's the actual log message itself that is the issue.

Ok, I've removed the logs from the create_app entirely. It looks like the logger is being called twice in the blueprints file but still not being called at all in "Interaction". We can see that the print statement is still showing up though

Yes, importing the same logger object should work, as long as the logger is set up correctly and the log messages are at an appropriate level. 

One other thing you could look into is whether your logger is actually being added to the Flask application correctly.

You may have noticed that each Blueprint has its own logger object that is created at the top of their respective files. You should try to use the same logger object used throughout the Flask application for each route by importing it at the top of each route. By doing so, all the log statements in the blueprint and child routes will be outputted to the console/log file.

For example, in the `routes/twilio_message.py` file, instead of creating a new logger object at the top of the file, you could import the existing `logger` object from `logs/logger.py`:

```
from logs.logger import logger

...
...
print('message here')
``` 

Then you can use `print` statements within that route, and it should write to the same log file and console as the rest of the app.

@role:user
Yeah, I am still not recieving the logs in the routes. I am importing "from logs.logger import logger" in each route. I think that should be the same object everywhere
---
@role:assistant
I see. Since the logging level is set to INFO, it's not a problem of verbosity. Are you still not receiving other log messages from other parts of the application?

If so, it could be that the routes you are having trouble with are not using the same logger as the rest of the application. Could you check if that's the case? 

For example, in the `twilio_message` and `twilio_call` routes, I see that `logger` is being used (i.e., `print('message here')`). Could you check if this is the same logger object that you've been using for the rest of the application?	If not, you could pass the same logger to these two routes (e.g., `twilio_message(logger)`), and then refer to that object throughout the routes.

I see. It could be that the logging level is set too high. By default, the logging level is set to WARNING, which means anything below that level won't be displayed. You could set your logging level to INFO like this:

```
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

I also noticed that on line 14 of `logs/logger.py`, there is a typo in the `logging.getLogger(__name_-)` method - it should be a double underscore after `__name`. Could you try updating this line to see if it makes a difference?

Without seeing the full codebase, it's hard to tell. But it seems like the logger is working fine and prints to the console as expected. 

I would suggest adding additional logging statements to each of the routes where you are having issues, and further debugging the problem. For example, you could add logging to the beginning and end of each route to see if the function is getting called, or logging statements in the middle of each route to see what's happening at each stage.

In that case, could you try changing line 17 in `context/app.py` from `print("Creating app")` to `print("Creating app")`, then run your application again and see if "Creating app" is printed in your console output? We are checking if the logging configuration is the source of the problem.

It seems like there might be something wrong with the way you are configuring your logger. What platform are you running this code on?

@role:user
My logger does not appear to be working. It does not print to the console or to the votebuddy.log file I have created. As far as I can tell I am initializing it correctly. One example where it should be used is in line 22 of interactin.py. The print statement works which indicates that I am connected to the shell, but the log does nothing
