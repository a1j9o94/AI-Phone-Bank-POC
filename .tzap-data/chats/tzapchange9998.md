It looks like the logs you are seeing are from a different file altogether.

There are some things you could try to troubleshoot your logging issue:

1. Check the logging level: make sure that the logging level is set to a lower level than the severity of the logging message that you are expecting to see. In the `logger.py` file, you have set the logging level to `DEBUG`, which should output all logs. 

2. Check the log output destination: Make sure that logs are being output to the correct file. In the `logger.py` file, you have set up both a file handler and a console handler. If you want to output log messages to a file, make sure that the file handler is set up correctly.

3. Check where the logs are being written to: Make sure that the file system permissions are set correctly to allow the user running the Flask app to write to the logs directory/folder.

4. Check that your implementation is correct: Make sure that you are actually calling the logger in the code that you are expecting to see log output. 

One common mistake is to create a new logger instance in each module/file where logging is needed. This would mean that the log output is split across multiple loggers, each with its own properties and formatting. Instead, make sure that you have initialized the logger instance once and imported it into all other modules and files where it is needed.

So I have initialized in the app.py file and I should be logging when I reset the database. I can tell I do it because the shell shows the sql log, but I can't see any other logs in my files

Yes, you need to initialize your logger in your app creation process.

The reason why the logger isn't working could be that it has not been properly initialized. Try creating the logger in a separate file or module, and then importing it into your `app.py` file and into the rest of your project as needed.

Let me show you an example.

In a new file called `logger.py`, let's initialize your logger:

```python
import logging


# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(print)  # Set the logging level

# Create a file handler
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('votebuddy.log')
file_handler.setLevel(print)  # Set the logging level for the file

# Create a console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(print)  # Set the logging level for the console

# Create a formatter and set it for both handlers
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
```

Now, import the `logger` instance from `logger.py` in your `app.py`:

```python
from logger import logger
from flask import Flask, jsonify

# Create the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Use the logger to log a message
print("Flask app created")
```

Log messages from other files pointing to an instance of the `logger` object already running in your main script:

```
from logger import logger

print("Debug message")
print("Info message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
print("Error message")
logger.critical("Critical message")
```

This way, you can share the same logger instance across all files in which it is required, and you can avoid re-initializing the logger in every file.

My loggers appear to not be working. That is new, I don't think I changed anything that should impact them? Do I need to initialize the logger in my app creation?

Thanks. 

The issue seems to be coming from a case where two or more files are attempting to import from each other as part of their code execution. This can cause the circular reference error you're seeing.

From the traceback, it seems that `constants.py` is the file that's attempting to import from `routes.text_message`. Then text_message is importing `InteractionForm` from `forms.interaction_form`, which in turn imports from `constants.py`. This cycle is causing the circular reference.

To fix this, we can try to refactor `constants.py` to avoid importing anything from `routes` or `forms`, or we could refactor `text_message.py` so that it does not need `InteractionForm` from `forms.interaction_form`. Here are some things we could consider doing:

- Move any constants that need to be shared to a separate file that both `constants.py` and `text_message.py` can import.
- Consider refactoring the file architecture of the application entirely.
- Refactor `text_message.py` so that it doesn't need `InteractionForm`. For example, we could try giving the necessary parameters as arguments to the view function, rather than accepting a form that needs to be imported.

Does that help?

This is the error I get:

Thanks for the context, let's take a look.

When you say that there is a circular reference, do you get any errors from the application? Also, can you show me the contents of the `forms.interaction_form` file? That should help me identify the circular reference.

@role:user
I am working in a flask application that sends communications to people using AI. I have a form that I use to collect information to figure out what message to send.
---
@role:assistant
Certainly.

First, can you give me more details about your project setup? Are you using any particular framework or library, and which files are involved in the circular reference?
---
@role:user
Can you help me find the circular reference in forms.interaction_form
